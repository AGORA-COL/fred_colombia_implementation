# FRED Agent Model for COVID-19 Outbreak

This repository contains the implementation of the FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) agent-based model for simulating the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in various departments of Colombia. The model allows for a realistic representation of individual behaviors and interactions, allowing users to study the spread of the disease and assess the impact of various intervention strategies.

## Project Description

The FRED agent model is a stochastic, agent-based simulation package designed to study the spread of diseases through a population. The simulation follows individuals as they go about their daily routines and interact with each other, potentially spreading the disease. This implementation of the FRED model aims to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic situation across different departments in Colombia.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* C++ compiler
* R 4.0 or newer
* (Optional) Jupyter lab

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AGORA-COL/fred_colombia_implementation.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd fred_colombia_implementation
```

## Outputs

The program will output a series of data tables showing the progression of the disease, such as number of infected, number of recovered, number of deceased individuals, Hospitalizations, and ICU usage over time.
